# Kali Configuration

I've used a bunch of themes, icons, and fonts. If you'd like to replicate
the same configurations, you need to:
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd dotfiles/kali`
3. Copy the contents of *each* folder in this directory to its corresponding folder in `~/`. This should follow the pattern `~/.{folder-name}`. For example, the contents of `fonts` would go in `~/.fonts`, `themes` in `~/.themes` and so on.


## Notes:
Note that the themes and icons in this folder are my customizations of the actual themes/icons provided by some amazing people.
